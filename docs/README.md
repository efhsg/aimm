# Documentation

This folder contains project documentation and the workflow contracts used by developers and AI agents.

## User Guides

- `docs/user/collection-guide.md` — how to configure and run data collection

## Start here

- `docs/PROJECT.md` — architecture, data flow, key concepts, glossary
- `docs/RULES.md` — global guardrails (coding conventions, architecture rules, testing baseline)
- `.claude/skills/index.md` — skill catalog (what capabilities exist)
- `docs/design/phase-1-collection.md` — Phase 1 technical design document

## How to contribute

- Keep docs focused and actionable.
- Prefer updating an existing skill over creating a new one.
- If a capability is missing, add a new skill under `.claude/skills/` and register it in `.claude/skills/index.md`.
