# Documentation

This folder contains project documentation and the workflow contracts used by developers and AI agents.

## Start here

- `docs/PROJECT.md` — architecture, data flow, key concepts, glossary
- `docs/RULES.md` — global guardrails (coding conventions, architecture rules, testing baseline)
- `docs/skills/index.md` — skill catalog (what capabilities exist)
- `docs/prompts/` — prompt templates and concrete use-cases

## How to contribute

- Keep docs focused and actionable.
- Prefer updating an existing skill over creating a new one.
- If a capability is missing, add a new skill under `docs/skills/<area>/...` and register it in `docs/skills/index.md`.
